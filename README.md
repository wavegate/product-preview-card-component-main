## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned about additional HTML elements and practiced styling with CSS.

For example, I learned that the s tag is for things like old ecommerce prices or other information that is no longer relevant, and automatically adds a strike-through. I also used the strong tag for the new price. I also learned to set line-height to prevent block text from changing size when resizing the font.

```html
<s>$169.99</s>
```

### Continued development

Looking forward to the next design!

### Useful resources

- [MDN HTML Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) - I explored the MDN HTML elements reference to learn about various elements.
